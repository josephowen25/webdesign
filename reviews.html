    <h2>Beach Reviews</h2>
        <article>
        <h3>Streedagh Beach</h3>
        <p>- Great for first timers as well as an enjoyable wave for the more experianced</p>
        <h4>Notable Features</h4>
            <p>- Stunning views of Benbulben as you surf in towards the shore. Great conditions year round with a little to no current ideal for young groms learning to surf. Personally a favourite of mine after a long day studying. The crisp waves and stunning views makes Streedagh a must visit for any travelling surfers coming to Sligo </p>

        <h3>Mullaghmore Head</h3>
            <p>- Only for the more advanced! Mullaghmore head is not surfable at all times like Streedagh as the wave only appears in stormy conditions. In saying this, you have to be an expert to surf this wave as it usually requires a jet ski tow. Waves here have exceeded 50ft tall! Even if you cannot surf it yourself, it really is an amazing spectacle to witness as man and nature engage in an almost hypnotic but terrifying endevor</p>
        <h4>Notable Features</h4>
            <p>- As well as having this incredible wave, Mullaghmore has an amazing array of activites to avail of. This includes a 4km long sandy beach, a Harbour and two hotels. The views here are incredible also as you have Benbulben drapped behind Classiebawn Castle. It really is well worth your visit! </p>
